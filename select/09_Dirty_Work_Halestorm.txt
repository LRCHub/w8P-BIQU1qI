Get on your knees
And let the games begin
Bow to your queen
And I will crown your head
'Cause I can make you every inch a king
Before I do it, tell me
Tell me what's in it for me
I need someone young, willing and able
You need someone old enough to know better
I want you to
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Oh
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Yeah
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Let me be your labor of love
My royal garden needs a hired man
Plant your seed, sow it
My rose's all in your hand
I need someone young, willing and able
You need someone old enough to know better
I want you to
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Oh
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Yeah
Come one
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Oh
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Yeah
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work

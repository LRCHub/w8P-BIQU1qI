[00:23.87] Times are hard
[00:25.45] You're afraid to pay the fee
[00:28.67] So you find yourself somebody
[00:31.96] Who can do the job for free
[00:45.46] 
[00:37.05] When you need a bit of lovin'
[00:40.16] 'Cause your man is out of town
[00:43.62] That's the time you get me runnin'
[00:46.79] And you know I'll be around
[01:00.29] 
[00:52.64] I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
[00:59.25] I don't wanna do your dirty work, no more
[01:05.74] I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
[01:26.24] 
[01:15.79] Light the candle
[01:17.33] Put the lock upon the door
[01:20.72] You have sent the maid home early
[01:23.94] Like a thousand times before
[01:37.94] 
[01:29.01] Like the castle in its corner
[01:32.28] In a medieval game
[01:35.57] I foresee terrible trouble
[01:38.93] And I stay here just the same
[01:53.43] 
[01:44.63] I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
[01:51.33] I don't wanna do your dirty work, no more
[01:57.71] I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
[02:18.21] 
[02:29.60] I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
[02:35.91] I don't wanna do your dirty work, no more
[02:42.63] I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
[03:03.13] 
[02:48.97] I don't wanna do your dirty work, no more
[02:55.45] I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
[03:02.12] I don't wanna do your dirty work
